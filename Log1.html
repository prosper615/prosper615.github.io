<h1>Learning as i go ( Notes from my 1 month of research)</h1>

LOGGING IT OUT RAW (1) üòä </br>
 " When the place goes dark. We need a light " </br>

I took off Twitter for a moment 17 July to 21st August 2035 to focus a bit on certain things.  
I was inquisitive to know what research was all about, due to the way I love to learn things, and I thought it would be a better approach for me.  
I felt there‚Äôs a level of advanced maths to know  + many other things, but decided just to go on for the sake of exploration and trying to satisfy my curiosity.  
Baby researcher mode, lol.

Everything took off with my goals:  
- Research on my interests (cryptography)  
- Continue writing and editing my short stories  
- Do some coding (if the power supply is restored in my area)

STARTING OUT 
I started out switching between research and my writing. I had dedicated my time to studying research on anonymous group messaging, deniable verification, zero-knowledge proof of location.

I had some progress going down the path of anonymous group messaging research, while others remained stagnant due to the fact that I was trying not to switch too fast ( constrain myself not to jump around a lot ) while writing and editing on some days.


A SUDDEN SWITCH 
Most of what I do depends on my phone and laptop. My laptop has no battery.  
So I would usually somewhere for now usually go to my friend‚Äôs house from holiday class years back, or to a church member‚Äôs house to charge my phone or any other available means.

It‚Äôs not easy to always stay with my laptop there, as the power supply is unpredictable.  
This situation led to me having almost nothing to do when I had taken out my phone for charging ‚Äî always having boredom at home while I wait.  
Since the research papers and books were all soft copies, this led me to revisit my notes and start thinking of some things which at that point, I had no clue about ‚Äî but decided to explore.
AI chatbots were very helpful in accelerating my endeavors.
I started exploring some well-known cryptography protocols, which led me to the rabbit hole I explored longer within this short period: " semi-prime factorization."
This spark came as a result of visualizing the problem.  
Though I plan to go back to my research on anonymous group messaging, unknown verification, and zero-knowledge proof of location,
looking at the way I had modeled things through my intuition and seeing patterns, I think I‚Äôll dwell on semi-prime factorization a bit more ‚Äî but sure likely I was going to fail.

I promise to put out my process on that too.

It‚Äôs funny I found myself doing maths.
All I have to say is that research seems very interesting, as much as writing  and maybe coding.

Here, I want to improve on my ability to constrain myself, not digress a lot.
