  LOGGING IT OUT RAW (4) ‚ù§Ô∏è <br>
    <p> 01/10/2025</p>

    <i> NB:I will walk through the ideas in simple terms and bring in math notation only when it's unavoidable / adds value</i>


    <h1>This kind of numbers : From primes to protocols</h1>

    For me primes are one of the most intresting numbers. Though has a pattern but unpredictable. 

    Mathematians over the years have tried to investigate it's properties and structure .

Many cryptographic primitives leverage on it's uniqueness e.g factorization of semiprimes and discrete log over primes <br>

<h1> What are primes </h1> <br>

Prime numbers are numbers that cannot be divided by any other number except one and it's self <br>
NB: prime numbers are odd, obviously even numbers are seived out of this except 2. All numbers 
apart from primes are ( or can be ) categorized as composite numbers
<br>

<h2> My journey to study primes </h2> <br>

<b> Firstly </b>: with novelty i sought patterns and characteristics on primes( personal experiments).
I was pondering on " large semiprimes are hard to factor" <br>
My main aim was to see gaps in primes and range of primes with a particular gap but big failure! and question followed
why don't research about studies on primes?  <br>
 
<b> Secondly </b>:  realised how difficult it is and the fact i have reached my limit based on the criteria (standard )
i set for my research mission "Intuition first before fall back on resources ". <br>

In the journey of primes i countered conjecturesssssss and theoremssssss üòä

Before i proceed to the conjectures and theorems, how do we test primes? <br>

 <b>Testing primes</b>:

 primes can be tested using either deterministic or probabilistic algorithms . 
 Probabilistic algorithms are usually used in cryptography applications. <br>

 Some primality testing algorithms / techniques :

 <ul>

    <li>Fermat's test  </li>
    <li> Trail division</li>
    <li>Sieve of Eratosthenes </li>
    <li>Miller-Rabin algorithm ( most pratical algorithm for testing primality widely used in cryptography algorithm) </li>

 </ul>

<h3> conjectures here, theorems there </h3>

Based on my intuition i try to categorize the conjectures and theorems based on some criteria <br>


 <h3> Primes are components of other numbers </h3>

   <u> <b> Canonical decomposition</b> : </u> Every positive integer > 1 can be written as a unique product of prime numbers raised to power <br>
  
   <u> <b> Chen's theorem</b> : </u> states that every sufficiently large even integer can  be written as a sum of two prime or semiprime <br>

   <u> <b> Goldbach's conjecture</b> : </u> Every integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers <br>

   <u> <b> Lemoines conjecture </b> : </u> Every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of a prime and twice a prime <br>
    n = p + 2q where p and q are prime numbers  <br>

    <u> <b> Vinogradov's theorem</b> : </u> Every sufficiently large odd number is a sum of three primes <br>



     <h3> Primes in a form ( structure) </h3>

     It is established that every prime > 3  has the form \( 6k \pm 1 \) <br>

      <u> <b> Fermat's prime </b> : </u> Fermat's prime are primes of the  form \( 2^{2n} + 1 \) where n is a positive integer <br>

       <u> <b> Mersenne primes</b> : </u> Mersenne prime has the form   \( 2^p + 1 \) <br>

        <u> <b> Blum prime </b> : </u> Blum prime are prime number such that \( p \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \)  <br>


        <h3> In between </h3>

        I categorize this ones as "in between "  beacuse in my perspective the can be categorized as primes in a form ( structure)
        and also as in the category of distribution of primes  <br>


            <u> <b> Twin prime   </b> : </u> twin prime conjecture states there are definetely many primes of the form p + 2 where p is also prime <br>

          <u> <b> polignac's conjecture </b> : </u> For every even number K there  are infinitely many consecutive primes that differ  by k ( kinda generalization  of twin prime conjecture ) <br>

           <u> <b> Sophie gemain primes </b> : </u> There are definetely  many primes of the form p  and 2p + 1 where p is prime  <br> 



   <u> <b> Dirichlet's theorem </b> : </u> For any two positive co-prime integers a and b there are definitely many primes of the form a + nd <br>
   

 <h3>Distribution or occurence of primes  </h3>

   
<u> <b> Legendres conjecture </b> : </u>  There ia always atleast one prime between \( n^2 \) and \( (n + 1)^2 \)
 <br>


<u> <b>Prime number theorem </b> : </u> The function pi(X ) counts the number of primes less than or equal to X, where we have
the approximation <br>

\( \pi(X) \approx \frac{X}{\log X} \)
 <br>

 
The prime theorem allows us to estimate of the probabilty of a random choosen number to be prime  = \( \frac{1}{\log p} \)
 <br>



   <u> <b>Green Tao theorem </b> : </u>  There exist abitarily a long arithemetic progression made up entirely of primes 

(Green-Tao showed that despite primes  having  density of  zero have abitarily long AP's) <br>

<u> <b> Opperman's conjecture</b> : </u>  For every natural number n > 1 there is atleast n^2 and n(n+1)

and n(n+1)  and ( n+1)^2  <br>


<u> <b> Betrande's postulate</b> : </u>  For every integer integer  greater than 1 there exist atleast on eprime between k and 2k

 
<h3> Prime gaps / gaps between primes </h3>

Gaps between is one of the intresting ones for me. Apart from the gap  between 2 and 3 which is 1 , other prime gaps are even

( Firstly i would enjoin you to look @ the research paper : GAPS BETWEEN PRIMES BY JAMES MARYNARD). it looks very sweet but pls finish it unlike me üòÇ)

<br>

<u> <b> Andrica's conjecture</b> : </u>  If pn be the nth prime number and gn be the gap between two consecutive
prime numbers. Andrica's conjecture states \( g_n < 2\sqrt{p_n} + 1 \) or more precisely the original form of the
conjecture \( \sqrt{p_n + 1} - \sqrt{p_n} < 1 \) <br>


<u> <b> Cramer's conjecture </b> : </u> Predicts the gap between consecutive primes grows like \( O((\log p_n)^2) \)

so for a large prime is  pn the next prime  is roughly within \( (\log p_n)^2 \)
steps <br> 


<u> <b> Wolf's conjecture</b> : </u> States the maximum gap between consecutive primes less than n


 

Also note  from the prime gap theorem it can be deduce that the gap between primes on an average is In(X)
where X is a number. <br> 





Now whats the implication of the gap and distribution in cryptography?
 prime gaps and distribution plays important roles in the feild of cryptography

  
<h3> Computational cost modelling </h3>

I would try to dipict this using prime number theory <br>

From  Prime number theorem \( \pi(X) \approx \frac{X}{\log X} \) that means density is \( \frac{1}{\log X} \)
 
this means we need an average of log(X) trials before we hit a prime for a number \( \leq X \)

seiving out even numbers   \( 0.5 (\log X) \) (obviously even numbers  cant be prime ) <br>

So kinda for prime generation the system latency = \( \text{number of trials} \times \text{number of CPU cycles} \)
 <br>

cpu cycles = number of clock or processsor cycle or the time it takes to compute a task by a system <br>

So if one say cycle = frequency <br>
so therefore cpu cycle time = 1/ cpu cycle

E.g for cpu with 2.5GHz cycle time = \( \frac{1}{2.5 \times 10^9} = 0.4 \text{ nanoseconds} \)
 <br>

Take T as the average number of trials , take T = 50000

System latency = \( 0.4 \times 5000 = 2000 \, \text{ns} = 2 \, \mu\text{s} \)
  <br>

why is this important?
<ul>

<li> Variable latency can lead to timing attacks</li>
<li>Can help us estimate the cost of key generation without trial and error </li>
<li> Faster key generation for low latency devices or apps ( e.g client side key generation for an end to end encrypted messaging app and low entropy devices) </li>


</ul>


<h3> Benchmaarking security assumptions : prime gaps & bias  </h3>

\text{Let } g_n = p_{n+1} - p_n \text{ be the prime gap. Cram√©r's conjecture states that } g_n \approx O((\log p_n)^2)
  <br>

Assume random number generator ( RNG ) picks a number uniformly in [ N, 2N] and prime gaps are small, the chance of hitting prime is <br>

\( P_{\text{hit}} = \sum_{k=N}^{2N} \frac{1}{N} P_{\text{hit}} \approx \frac{1}{\log N} \)
 <br>
NB: Giving weight 1 to Phit and 0 if it's not prime.

So if prime gaps increase abnormally Phit decreases causing longer  key generation time and biased output distribution <br>

<h3> Modelling failure probabilty : RNG coollision</h3>

Suppose RNG only selects from M different bitstrings <br>

P(M) be the probabilty  two output yeild the same output, if there are  pi(N) primes below N and RNG picks uniformly
from M possible values 

P_{\text{collision}} = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{M^2}{2\pi N}\right) <br>

This is the prime bound for prime numbers. If M is too small or primes are reused system could be vulnerable to

<ul>

  <li> Shared modulus attack</li>

   <li> Factoring common prime gaps  </li>


</ul>


In a nutshell : 

Prime gaps matters because if  large gaps appear in target range prime generation takes longer. E.g In low battery or constrained
this slows encryption, delays messages or leaks timing patterns which are exploitable for traffic analysis <br>
