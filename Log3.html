    LOGGING IT OUT RAW (3) üòä <br>

    <h1>Bounded : Pedersen as a commitment device</h1>
    
Crytography has been intresting for me because it seems like a game between two players <br>

let's say S who wants to secure information and A (the advesary for whatever intention ) who wants to unseal or compromise it  <br>

it's always cool for me to try to relate things to different situations, scenarios or fields ( even though sometimes it could be forcefully )   <br>

 Since i learnt about game theory ( better say heard) it's a great combo to relate (backup :Abstract on the paper cryptography and game theory by Yevgeniy Dodis, NYU and Tal Rabin, IBM)  <br>

 Game theory studies the situations of competition and co-operation between several involved parties by using mathematical methods <br>

 Sometimes as ealier stated my relation forcefully fit in my head  "this or that" concept with stackelberg game, payoff matrix or zero sum games etc <br>

 Still under this circumstance i try to relate this cryptography and game theory concept in my own way ( commitment device & Pedersen commitment scheme) <br>

 <h2> Commitment device + Pedersen commitment scheme</h2> 
  
 here i try my best to simply explain myself <br>

 <b> Imagine this scenario  ( I always encounter this ) :</b>

 In a church contribution you want to plegde 80 naira but don't want to reveal it at the moment
 you only reveal ( perphaps to the accountant ) when you pay. Now look! you got to be bounded to your pledge <br>

 How do we know you actually paid what you pledged ? <br>
 since it's not forcefully and  circumstance might make someone not to pay as pledged, how do we make someone bounded <br>

 Now i think the game theory thing comes in ( why would you lie in the church ? lol ). This could be attached to your reputation ( Imagine a pastor lieing about his commitment) <br>



<h3> What is a commitment device</h3>
A commitment device is a way to lock oneself to following a plan of action that one might not want to do but knows it's good for oneself  (yeah voluntarily adopted)<br>

<h4>  What is pedersen commitment scheme</h4>
Pedersen commitment scheme is a type of scheme that allows someone to commit to a value in a way that proves it wasn't changed <br>

It's based on discrete logarithm problem (dlh) , one of the number theoritic problems used in cryptography like factorization
of large semiprime, square root modulo n, quadratic residutory problem, subset sum etc <br>

Dlh is also the basis of some other cryptographic primitives such as DH-key exchange, Elgamal encryption <br>

NB: While typing i realised there might not be so much need pouring out the technical details of the protocol as i planned to do ( lol, loging it out raw. maybe oversharing  but is this my way to avoid using mathjax ?) <br>

 In summary : <br>

<summary>

‚Ä¢ Temporarily hide a value, but ensure that it
cannot be changed later <br>
‚Ä¢ 1st stage: commit
‚Äì Sender electronically ‚Äúlocks‚Äù a message in a box
and sends the box to the Receiver <br>
‚Ä¢ 2nd stage: reveal
‚Äì Sender proves to the Receiver that a certain
message is contained in the box <br>
